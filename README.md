WARNING: I could not work out how to lower the volume of my autoplaying audio so please make sure you are not on full volume when you open my website lest you get jumpscared or your ears bleed out.

Though also note that the audio may not play on the first open of the website when using the browser Google Chrome (Theory: because Google Chrome has a policy to stop intrusive unwanted popup ads, they will not allow audio to autoplay sometimes. -> https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/)
